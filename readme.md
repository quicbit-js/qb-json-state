# qb-json-state

Functions for working with JSON parse state - a set of properties that have parsing recovery information for
parsers like qb-json-tokv.  ParseState could have been an object, but tok keep parsing engines light-weight
and unchanging, we require only that they work with the minimal state itself, with no object/behavior requirements.

## State Serialization Strings

qb1 encodes data into packets with begin and end state encoded as a concise path-like string.  For a series of JSON packets, a packet may
begin and end with the states

    begin:     0/0/{[{F
    end:       50/5/{[2L
    
meaning packet begins with:
                        
    0           0 bytes processed
    0           0 values processed 
    {[{F        inside object, then array, then object.  parse position before the very (F)irst value
        
and ends with:
    
    50          50 bytes processed 
    5           5 values processed
    {[V2        inside object then array within a truncated (V)alue 2 bytes long.  IOW, parsing is positioned
                within a value at bytes 48 and 49.
    
The details of **parse state** format is explained in detail below

#### Parse State ####

Parse state is all the parsing data needed to continue parsing from any point, including from within partially-parsed
keys and values.

Parse state format is designed to be very compact and yet somewhat intuitive.  It consists of
stack context, position, and end-code.

Stack context or simply 'stack' is a string of 
zero or more array or object open braces: '[{{[ ...' that indicate the depth and type of containers we are currently
within.  

parse-position is a position letter (F, J, K, L, U, V, or W) plus lengths of the pending key or
unfinished value.  parse-position can represent partial keys, values or any point between keys and values.

### parse state 'encoding' format

The grammer rules below may make parse states seem harder to understand then they truly are.  Put simply, all parse
states have a byte-count, value-count, and position-letter (F, J,K,L, U,V,W) indicating a specific position in parsing
an object.  K represents a truncated (K)ey, while V indicates a truncated (V)alue.  Letters before and after K (J and L) 
represent positions before and after key, while letters before and after V (U and W)represent positions before and after 
an array or object value.  Positions K, L, and V always have length counts while F, J, and W never have length
counts (they have no pending state), and U (before value) only has counts in object context to track pending
keys.

    root position allows comma-separated value lists, so we can continue...

    > [ 1, 2 ],            U                    before value (after comma)
    > [ 1, 2 ], null       W                    after value

## Incremental Parsing and Packets

A chunk of data is called a "packet".  In Quicbit, packets contain a start and
end state which indicates the precise parse starting and ending point of a packet.  Quicbit is
able to start and end parsing at any point, even across split values (allowing split values
in packages is configurable).


### Packet Series ###
    
A series of packets prepends two comma-delimited sections to the packet single information described
above.  These sections track context counts and parsing state for split buffers.  Parse state handling
is designed to handle any-length key or value such as very large strings, that span packets without 
requiring data to be accumulated in memory.

            
Those are state representations with no prescient knowledge of updoming counts.   
If total counts are known, colon-values may be used to show 'out-of' totals as in
    
    0:5         0 out of 5 total values
    0:50        0 out of 50 total bytes
    
Which in the state string looks like this:
    
    0:5/0:50/{[/-
